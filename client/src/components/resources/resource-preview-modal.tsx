DAILY TASKS
□ Check low-stock alerts (< 10 units)
□ Review backorder queue
□ Process incoming shipments
□ Update inventory counts post-fulfillment

REORDER POINT CALCULATION
Reorder Point = (Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Max Daily Sales × Max Lead Time - Avg Daily × Avg Lead

EXAMPLE:
Product: Ceramic Mug Set
Avg daily sales: 5 units
Lead time: 14 days
Max daily: 8, Max lead: 21 days
Safety Stock = (8 × 21) - (5 × 14) = 98 units
Reorder Point = (5 × 14) + 98 = 168 units

API SYNC FREQUENCY
• Inventory levels: Every 15 minutes
• Price updates: Every 6 hours
• Product details: On change (webhook)
• Order sync: Real-time (webhook)

END-OF-SEASON CLEARANCE
1. Identify slow movers (< 2 units/month)
2. Apply 20-40% wholesale discount
3. Create "Sale" collection on Faire
4. Email top retailers about clearance
5. Remove listings after 60 days if unsold`,
