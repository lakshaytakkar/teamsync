# TeamSync - Multi-Vertical Team Portal

## Overview
TeamSync is a multi-vertical team portal with exceptional UI/UX inspired by the Dropship.io design system. The vertical switcher shows two labeled groups: "Business Products" and "Departments". Each vertical/department has its own dashboard, pages, brand logo, and workflows. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

**Business Products** (7): Suprans Business Services (`/suprans`), LegalNations (`/hr`), USDrop AI (`/sales`), GoyoTours (`/events`), LBM Lifestyle (`/admin`), EazyToSell (`/ets`), FaireDesk (`/faire`)

**Departments** (8): HRMS (`/hrms`), ATS (`/ats`), Sales CRM (`/crm`), Finance & Accounts (`/finance`), Order & Fulfillment OMS (`/oms`), Event Management (`/hub`), Developer (`/dev`), SMM (`/social`)

## Suprans Business Services (`/suprans/*`) — indigo #3730A3

## System Architecture

### Multi-Vertical Architecture
The portal supports multiple business verticals, each with its own navigation, brand logo, and pages:
- **Verticals Config** (`client/src/lib/verticals-config.ts`): Defines all verticals with their navigation categories and brand logos
- **Vertical Store** (`client/src/lib/vertical-store.ts`): React context for current vertical state, persisted to localStorage
- **Vertical Switcher** (`client/src/components/layout/vertical-switcher.tsx`): Dropdown in topbar to switch between verticals, shows brand logos

### Universal Sections (Cross-Vertical)
4 universal pages exist under `client/src/pages/universal/` and are shared by all 7 verticals. Each page detects its vertical via `detectVerticalFromUrl(useLocation())` and filters mock data from `client/src/lib/mock-data-shared.ts` by `verticalId`.

**Nav order (standardized for all verticals):** Dashboard → Chat → Team → Resources → Tasks → [vertical-specific sections]

- **Chat** (`/[prefix]/chat`) — Two-panel layout: 380px sidebar (Channels/DMs tabs with unread badges) + full-width message area (message bubbles, phone/video icons, send input bar)
- **Team** (`/[prefix]/team`) — Card grid of vertical team members with avatar, status dot, role, contact info, hover action row (Message/Call). "Invite Member" FormDialog header CTA. Search + department + status filters.
- **Resources** (`/[prefix]/resources`) — File card grid with pinned strip, category filter pills, grid/list toggle. Type-colored file icons (pdf=red, excel=green, ppt=orange, doc=blue, link=violet). Detail dialog with metadata + Open Resource button. "Add Resource" FormDialog.
- **Tasks** (`/[prefix]/tasks`) — Kanban board (5 columns: Backlog/Todo/In Progress/Review/Done) with task cards (priority badge, tags, due date, assignee avatar), List view, My Tasks tab. Task create dialog + Task detail dialog (subtask checklist, status select, comments). Stats row (Total/In Progress/Overdue/Done).

**Shared mock data** (`client/src/lib/mock-data-shared.ts`): TypeScript interfaces + mock data for all 7 verticals:
- `VerticalMember[]` — 4 members per vertical, with status (online/away/offline), skills, location
- `ChatChannel[]` — channels + DMs per vertical, with unread counts, isPinned, lastMessage
- `ChatMessage[]` — messages per channel, with isMe boolean for sender styling
- `SharedResource[]` — 5-6 resources per vertical, categories: Brochure/Script/Spreadsheet/Link/Presentation/Document/Template
- `SharedTask[]` — 8-9 tasks per vertical, across all 5 statuses and 4 priorities, with subtask arrays

**Route renames** (3 existing routes moved to avoid conflicts with universal `/tasks` and `/resources`):
- `/hr/tasks` (LegalNations Task Board) → `/hr/task-board`
- `/dev/tasks` (Developer ClickUp-style board) → `/dev/board`
- `/dev/resources` (Developer Knowledge Base) → `/dev/knowledge-base`

### Universal Important Contacts (`/[prefix]/contacts`)
- **Available on ALL 11 verticals**: hr, sales, events, hub, admin, dev, ets, faire, hrms, ats, social
- Vertical-aware filtering: shows contacts scoped to the current vertical + shared contacts (`verticalIds: ["all"]`)
- 3-per-row contact cards with priority dots, category badges, country flags, tags, action buttons (WhatsApp/Email/Phone/Copy)
- Stats strip: Total, High Priority, Shared, Categories
- Search + Category filter + Priority filter
- "Add Contact" FormDialog
- Mock data: `client/src/lib/mock-data-contacts.ts` — 40 contacts across all verticals

### Brand Logo Components
Each vertical has a unique SVG logo in hexagonal mascot style:

- `client/src/components/brand/usdrop-ai-logo.tsx` — Box+arrow/dropship icon
- `client/src/components/brand/goyotours-logo.tsx` — Compass icon
- `client/src/components/brand/lbm-lifestyle-logo.tsx` — Heart-star/lifestyle icon
- `client/src/components/brand/developer-logo.tsx` — Terminal/code icon
- `client/src/components/brand/eazytosell-logo.tsx` — Shopping bag/lock/retail icon

### Frontend Technology
React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Wouter routing, motion/react animations.

### Routing
- All verticals use consistent `/vertical/*` URL namespacing
- Root `/` redirects to `/hr` (default vertical)
- Deep links auto-detect the correct vertical via `detectVerticalFromUrl`

### Navigation
- **Two-Level Horizontal Top Navigation**: Dynamic based on active vertical
- **Vertical Switcher**: Shows brand logo, allows switching between products (navigates to target vertical's dashboard)
- **Level 1**: Category tabs (change per vertical)
- **Level 2**: Sub-page navigation within active category — styled with primary blue background for visual separation

## UI Rules (Enforced)

These rules apply to every page and must never be violated when adding or editing pages:

### 1. Page Padding Standard
All page root wrappers must use `<div className="px-16 py-6 lg:px-24">`. Never use `p-6`, `px-6`, `px-6 lg:px-12`, or any narrower wrapper as the outermost container of a page.

### 2. Full-Height App Layouts (Tasks, Chat)
For pages with a fixed-height layout (scroll area fills remaining height), do NOT wrap the whole page in `px-16`. Instead:
- Sticky bars (header bar, filter bar, stats strip): apply `px-16 lg:px-24` horizontally on each bar individually
- Scrollable content area (`<ScrollArea>`): apply `px-16 py-6 lg:px-24`
- Stats strip first/last cells: first cell uses `pl-16 lg:pl-24 pr-5`, last cell uses `pl-5 pr-16 lg:pr-24`

### 3. Stats / Metrics Rule
Only show stats cards on dashboards and list pages where the data is a meaningful operational KPI (e.g. active clients, revenue, pipeline count). Do NOT add stats to library or directory pages such as Resources.

### 4. Search Bar Rule
Only include a search bar when there are 6 or more items in a list to filter. Do not add search to small static lists.

### 5. Detail Pages Rule
Every entity with a list page must also have a dedicated detail page or detail dialog. This applies to: clients, leads, products, events, attendees, vendors, etc.

### 6. Contact Actions Rule
Every page that lists or shows details for a person (client, lead, user, attendee, vendor) must include actionable contact buttons:
- **List pages**: WhatsApp and/or Email as inline icon-only ghost buttons in a "Contact" column (not in the dropdown menu)
- **Detail pages**: WhatsApp and Email as outline buttons in the header/profile action bar
- **WhatsApp** link: `https://wa.me/{phone.replace(/\D/g,'')}` — open in `target="_blank"` — icon: `SiWhatsapp` from `react-icons/si`, colored `text-green-600`
- **Email** link: `mailto:{email}` — icon: `Mail` from `lucide-react`
- Add `data-testid="btn-whatsapp-{id}"` and `data-testid="btn-email-{id}"` to every link
- Only add WhatsApp if the entity has a `phone` field in its type; only add Email if it has an `email` field
